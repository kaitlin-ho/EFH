# Erica's Fans and Hugo (EFH)

## Roster: Ariella Katz, Kaitlin Ho, Hugo Jenkins, Tom, Apple, Boary

### Project Description:
The Ducky RPG is an extention of Yo_RPG. The Player answers questions posed by NPCs in order to win equipment. There are 3 NPCs that correspond to different topics: Mr. Kats for math, Mr. Mykolyk for computer science, and Erica for general trivia. Equipment won is added to the Player's inventory, from which a maximum of 2 pieces of equipment can be equipped at a time. Equipment enhances the Player's stats when fighting Monsters. The Player fights 5 Monsters of either low or moderate difficulty (the proportion of low:moderate depends on the difficulty selected by the Player) and if this is completed, the Player fights a final Boss Monster. The game is won when the Boss is defeated. The Player also has a Ducky which follows them around. The Player can ask the Ducky for advice at any time and the Ducky will provide valuable advice. There is also a twist at the end, but you must play the game to find out what it is.

### How To Launch:
```
$ javac Woo.java  
$ java Woo  
```
The above commands will compile all of the necessary code and launch the game. If the Boss is defeated and there appears to be some sort of lag or run-time error, please allow for at least 10 seconds before forcibly exiting the game via Ctrl+C. We ask that you do not exit the game before the 10 seconds have elapsed.
