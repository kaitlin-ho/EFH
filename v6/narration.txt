Beginning of the game, after choosing difficulty

Hello? Uh... Hello? Can you hear me? I don't think they can hear me. O Great Adventurer! Can you hear me?

<yes> - LINE 105

You can! What's your name?

- prompt player to enter their name

<name, but messed up>! I've been trying to reach you for over ten years now. You're the destined one.
Destined for what, you ask? Destined to be our savior. Our hero. Our world has been riddled with monsters
who have destroyed our crops and ruined our cities. They attack in everlasting waves, controlled by their
Boss. We need YOU, <name> to defeat the big ma- Uh. I mean the boss monster. The adventurers before, well.
Well, they kind of suck. We have a bunch of their skeletons in our closet. Sometimes we feed them to our dog.
Ha Ha. But you! The divine prophet, oh so wise and fair, spoke of you. She said you're our only hope, our Hercules.
You know, that Greek guy? Will you help us?

<yes>

Hurrah, hurrah! Let's get going! What? Ducky? Do they not know about that already? Oh really...
Sigh, I guess I'll have to explain. So, <name>, since I've received intelligence that you somehow,
do not know what a Ducky is, I will explain them to you. Duckies are a magical omniscient race, renowned for their
expansive knowledge. The wild ones cannot be tamed, but we have a tamed one just for you.

Here, hold it. Simply give it a name, and it will be yours.

- prompt player to enter ducky name

<duckyname>? Oh! I think it likes its name! That's a first. They're very hard to please, you know. <duckyname> will
follow you 'till your death. It's pretty lazy, so it'll only respond to it's name or "help" during battles or conversations
with the Questioners. Don't bother trying to talk to it any other time.

<Questioners?> - LINE 168

Huh? My lunch is ready? Well, <name>, I have to go, it's time to eat!

- the main menu choices

*change to see a Questioner


IF NPC
Why do I (can we italics it) have to do this? Why don't you do it!
...
Fine.
My brave adventurer! This is a Questioner, an elite being that transcends
mortality. They are other-worldly blacksmiths, the finest out there. They do not accept mere
human currency as payment for their extraordinary weapons and armor. In love with riddles and questions,
they will deem you worthy of their pieces of work if you answer correctly. Each person may only answer 2
questions, though, as they do not have time for more than that. I wish you luck!

IF MONSTER
I'm back, I'm back! Just in time. By the way, that food was quite yummy, if I say so myself. Anyway, I see you've met
your first monster. It's your first battle! Aren't you excited?

<no.> <yes> - LINE 252

It doesn't matter, get ready! Oh- And, I hope you've talked to the Questioners. You'll really need their help. Have fun!

<the instructions to fight>


IF BOSS
What the- It's the boss! He never showed up this quickly for our other adventurers. I knew you were special.
We are almost free! Terror no more! The final battle, isn't this just exhilarating?  Go <name>, go!

IF BOSS < 1/4 HP
It's almost dead, just a few more hits!

IF BOSS dead
...
You-
...
YOU DID IT! <name caps>, OUR SAVIOR! HERO! LIBERATION FOR ALL! Hurry, tell everyone! Her? Yes, the divine prophet too.
...
Do you hear that? The townspeople are cheering for you. Oh, not just them. The continent is cheering for you. Huzzah!
You've saved them from the tyranny of those disgusting creatures. What? Oh, really? <name>! Someone's just told me
they're planning a huge celebration for you tonight. You can use my cabin to clean that dirty blood off yourself and rest
up before the big party. I'll go help them set things up. See you there!



<ducky name>, let's go back to the cabin

<ducky>? Lets go?

<ducky>: You are not the hero. You are not worthy of being the chosen one.

<???>

<ducky>: You. Are. Not. Worthy.

<i am. I killed the boss. I saved the people.>

<ducky>: Ah. That doesn't make you any different from the rest of the useless humans. You barely answered the Questioner's
questions. *italics I* I will be the judge. And I will smite you if you do not live up to what you claim to be.

<of course I will!>

<ducky>: Speak carefully. You are talking to a member of the unparalleled Ducky Race. Ready yourself.

- instructions, then start the questioning
