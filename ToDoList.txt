TO DO LIST:
- make an unequip option for the player
- add questions and answers for trivia
- balance the stats
- COMMENTSS 

IF WE TIME:
- change normal battle mechanics
	- specialize and normalize OR add special skills to some items 
- easter eggs!
	- typing something gives player items (like strength pot, healing pot) ["..." gives you something useless]
